# Code Coverage Analysis

Date: 2025-07-21

## Overall Coverage
- **Instruction Coverage**: 64% (15,025 of 23,349)
- **Branch Coverage**: 53% (894 of 1,673)
- **Method Coverage**: 71% (844 of 1,315)
- **Class Coverage**: 77% (134 of 189)

## Low Coverage Areas

### 1. com.lucimber.dbus.exception (0% coverage)
- 31 exception classes with no test coverage
- 765 uncovered instructions
- These are D-Bus protocol exceptions that should be tested

### 2. com.lucimber.dbus.util (14% coverage)
- 125 uncovered instructions
- Utility classes need more test coverage

### 3. com.lucimber.dbus.netty.sasl (31% coverage)
- SASL authentication implementation
- 1,241 uncovered instructions
- Complex authentication flows need more testing

### 4. com.lucimber.dbus.connection.sasl (48% coverage)
- Connection-level SASL handling
- 120 uncovered instructions

## High Coverage Areas
- **com.lucimber.dbus.type**: 94% coverage (D-Bus type system)
- **com.lucimber.dbus.encoder**: 92% coverage (Message encoding)
- **com.lucimber.dbus.decoder**: 86% coverage (Message decoding)

## Recommendations
1. Priority: Add unit tests for all exception classes
2. Add tests for utility classes
3. Improve SASL authentication test coverage
4. Focus on branch coverage in connection handling code
