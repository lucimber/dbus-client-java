## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Docker (for integration tests)
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dbus-client-java.git
   cd dbus-client-java
   ```
3. **Set up the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/lucimber/dbus-client-java.git
   ```
4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if someone is already working on what you want to do
2. **Create an issue** if one doesn't exist for your change
3. **Discuss your approach** in the issue before starting work on large changes

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following the [Code Style](#code-style) guidelines
3. **Write tests** for your changes
4. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ./gradlew integrationTest
   ```
5. **Commit your changes** with appropriate [commit messages](#commit-messages)
6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

For memory-intensive tests:
```bash
./gradlew test -PwithMemoryIntensiveTests
```

### Integration Tests

Run integration tests (containerized):
```bash
./gradlew integrationTest
```

With verbose output:
```bash
./gradlew integrationTest -PshowOutput
```

### Performance Tests

Run performance tests:
```bash
./gradlew performanceTest
```

### Code Coverage

Generate coverage reports:
```bash
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest changes from upstream:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear description of the changes
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

3. **Address review feedback** promptly and professionally

4. **Ensure all checks pass**:
   - CI builds successfully
   - All tests pass
   - Code coverage is maintained or improved

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep PRs focused** - one feature or bug fix per PR
- **Write descriptive titles** and descriptions
- **Include tests** for new functionality
- **Update documentation** if needed
- **Follow the PR template** provided

## Code Style

### Java Code Style

- **Follow standard Java conventions**
- **Use 4 spaces for indentation** (no tabs)
- **Line length**: 120 characters maximum
- **Use meaningful variable and method names**
- **Add JavaDoc** for public APIs
- **No trailing whitespace**

### Code Quality Tools

The project uses several code quality tools:

- **Checkstyle**: Enforces coding standards
- **PMD**: Static code analysis
- **JaCoCo**: Code coverage measurement

Run quality checks:
```bash
./gradlew check
```

### Architecture Guidelines

- **Follow the existing patterns** in the codebase
- **Handlers can safely perform blocking operations** - they run on dedicated thread pools
- **Use the builder pattern** for complex message construction
- **Prefer immutable objects** where possible
- **Handle errors gracefully** and provide meaningful error messages
